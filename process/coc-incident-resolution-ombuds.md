# Code of Conduct Incident Resolution and Ombuds
This document is a companion to the W3C Code of Conduct. It describes the procedures for handling incidents relating to Code of Conduct violations or complaints.

## Introduction
As we engage with one another, incidents can happen. Incidents can take many forms, but participants have the right to a safe and positive work environment. The goal of this incident resolution process is that participants in W3C can:

- Get help and support to safely resolve issues that negatively affect them
- Change behaviors that negatively affect other participants in W3C
- Continue to safely work and contribute to the W3C after an issue has been raised

The Code of Conduct is the standard that all W3C participants are required to follow and is used as the basis for any resolution and disciplinary actions. In exceptional circumstances, individuals may have their W3C participation suspended or withdrawn as a result of a complaint or investigation.

All situations are different and W3C participants are encouraged to use whichever method of incident resolution they feel comfortable with.

Participants are encouraged to try to resolve issues themselves if they feel safe doing so. Participants may contact a chair or team contact for help. However, if participants do not feel comfortable or safe resolving issues on their own or with the help of a team contact, they can get help through an ombud.

Depending on the severity of the situation, it may not be appropriate to attempt to resolve the issue informally or in the context of the group. Participants should report an incident as soon as possible if they feel unsafe or threatened by the behavior or actions of other W3C participants.

Everyone involved in the resolution process is expected to:
- Show respect for others
- Work together to resolve the complaint
- Exercise good judgment, and make reasonable efforts to protect privacy and confidentiality of all participants

## Incident Resolution Procedures
When an incident arises it is important for everyone involved to know what will happen and what resources are available to them. Any time a Code of Conduct violation or complaint occurs it is important that those involved, especially the party/parties affected by the incident, feel supported and respected.

How an incident is handled will depend on a number of factors including the type of incident, severity, frequency, and contributing factors. For example, has anyone been involved in incidents before? Is there a pattern?

The procedure for addressing an incident will include some or all of the following:
1. Incident is addressed directly with the parties involved, if appropriate.
2. A community member may report an incident to a Chair, Ombuds, member of Team or through an anonymous report where allowable by law. 
3. Incident is discussed by the reporter, parties involved, and those reported to. Impact is shared and a resolution is proposed.
4. Ombuds will respond within two business days. 
5. Resolution at end of process.

For incidents that have a clear path to resolution and low severity (for example, a harsh criticism in a meeting or inappropriate language), the focus should be on coming to a shared understanding of what happened and agreeing to a path to resolution, such as an apology, agreed understanding for changes, or editing a comment or minutes.

## Ombuds
Ombuds are neutral third party advisors to participants who can provide guidance, advice, and support during the conflict resolution process. Where appropriate, ombuds can help mediate a process, but the role is mostly to help parties navigate next steps.

The ombud positions are currently held by:
- Catrina Ahlbach catrina@w3.org
- Christine Gefaell christine@w3.org 

Ombuds can also be reached at ombuds@w3.org.
