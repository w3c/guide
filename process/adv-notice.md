title: Announcing the start of Charter Refinement
toc: yes
---

The W3C Process defines a [charter refinement phase](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#charter-initiation) to help ensure that charter drafts are mission-aligned, reflect community input and consensus, and have been well-socialized and widely reviewed *before* Advisory Committee review.

This document describes how the W3C Communications Team announces the
start of charter refinement with a *charter review notice*. For
information about when the Strategy Team may request that the W3C Communications
Team send this announcement and activities following this
announcement, see [How to create a Working Group or Interest
Group](charter.md).

# Drafting the charter review notice

Per [section 4.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#charter-initiation) the charter review notice must include the following:

* A short summary of the proposal.
* The location of the charter draft, which must be public.
* How to participate in the discussion of this charter draft and where to file issues.
* The expected duration of the charter refinement phase, which must not be less than 28 days, and should not be more than 6 months.
* Who the Chartering Facilitator is.

In addition, the Strategy Team *may* include its own perspectives about the charter in the review notice.

Please use the [charter review notice template](https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2F&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcharter-review-notice.html&amp;submit=Continue...) to create an initial draft.

# Sending the charter review notice

The W3C Communications Team sends the charter review notice to:

* w3c-ac-members@w3.org (then forwards it to chairs@w3.org).
* The affected group (in the case of a rechartering).

In addition, unless this notice requires Member-only confidentiality
(which should be rare), the W3C Communications Team also sends the notice
to:

* public-new-work@w3.org
* new-work@ietf.org

# After the notice has been sent

[Section 4.2 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/drafts/#charter-development) describes activities during the refinement phase, and in particular the role of the Charter Facilitator to seek consensus and how and when any Formal Objections are handled.

**Note**: Advance notice is not an indication that work *will* necessarily progress to Advisory Committee review.
