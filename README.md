# Guide

The repository for "[The Art of Consensus](https://www.w3.org/guide/)", W3C's Chair's Guidebook.

Documentation on how to participate in W3C Working Groups is split between multiple wikipages, github repos and emails. This means new members find difficulty in finding information as to how to participate and maybe give up trying. This repository is the place to pull all of those together.

## Got a question?

Feel free to join #general in [irc](https://webirc.w3.org/?channels=general) or [slack](https://w3ccommunity.slack.com/) ([invite](https://www.w3.org/slack-w3ccommunity-invite)).

### How to edit

Pull requests are welcome from the Community. This Guide is for you after all.

The general edition of the Guidebook is managed by [@w3c/guidebook](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/guidebook) but many areas are maintained by separate individuals or teams (check out the commits history of a file to see who).

The Guidebook uses the [W3C Jekyll theme](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-jekyll-theme). See the [README](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-jekyll-theme/blob/main/README.md) to run Jekyll locally.

Note that latest versions of Ruby might create a [dependency issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/9392). It is recommended to use the Ruby version mentioned in the [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/w3c/guide/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml#L24).
